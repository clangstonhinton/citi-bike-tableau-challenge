## Background
Since 2013, the Citi Bike ride-sharing program has grown to become largest of its kind in the world with an average of 2.7 million rides per month. The program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike website. 

## Data Description
For this analysis, 60 million records were systematically sampled across the two year period ending March 31, 2023. The sampled dataset can be found in the XX data folder above.  The data contain the following columns:
- Ride Id
- Rideable Type (type of bike rented: docked, classic or electric)
- Started At (date and time the ride started)
- Start Station Name
- Start Station ID
- Ended At (data and time the ride ended)
- End Station Name
- End Station ID
- Start Station Lat/Lng
- End Station Lat/Lng
- Member Casual (designnation between member/subscriber or causal/non-member rider)


## Questions to Answer:
- How has ridership grown during the two year period?
- Is there seasonality to the volume of rides within a year?
- Do the peak riding hours differ between warmer months and cooler months of the year?
- What are the Top 10 stations for starting a ride in the most recent month?  Ending a ride?
- How has the proportion of short-term "causal" customers and annual subscribers or "members" changed during the two year period?
